        <p class="text_para">
            Since the new <span style="color:blue">corona-virus</span> has spread and much, either true or false information, has been transmitted between people about the disease and its treatment methods, Does <span style="color: yellow">vitamin C</span>            treat the corona-virus? With the increase of the new coronavirus since the beginning of 2020,<br> researchers are trying to find a solution to it, they have also begun to study the effect of vitamin C as they think it may help.<br> As many
            people take different sources of
            <span style="color: yellow">vitamin C</span> in the winter in order to fight and fight influenza and colds,<br> it helps in the production of white blood cells to help the immune system fight the virus, but the fact is that <span style="color: yellow">vitamin C</span>            helps shorten the period of the disease, not its treatment , According to a study published in 2017.<br> For this reason, the researchers recommend a daily intake 40 mg of <span style="color: yellow">vitamin C</span> per day, and eating a
            medium-sized pill of oranges provides you with more than what is recommended.<br> In contrast, researchers studied the role of <span style="color: yellow">vitamin C</span> and infection with the new coronavirus, by giving 120 patients daily
            doses of the vitamin.<br> Researchers led by Zhi-Yong Peng, from intensive care at Wuhan Medical Hospital, reported that the dose currently given to patients is high and greater than recommended, but they need more time to notice any results.<br>            On the other side , the British Ministry of Health indicated that taking high doses of <span style="color: yellow">vitamin C</span>,<br> more than 10 grams per day, would be associated with disturbing symptoms, such as: Collywobbles Diarrhea
            Flatulence and flatulence.<br> everyone is still waiting for the results of this study to confirm or deny the role of <span style="color: yellow">vitamin C</span> in the treatment of the COVID-19.
